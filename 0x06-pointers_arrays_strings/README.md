Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

This repository contains code examples and exercises for learning about pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

Pointers

Pointers are variables that store the addresses of other variables. They can be used to access and modify data in memory.

Arrays

Arrays are data structures that can store a collection of values of the same type. They are accessed by using an index, which is an integer value that starts at 0.

Strings

Strings are arrays of characters. They are terminated by a null character (\0).
