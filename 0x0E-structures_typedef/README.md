This project demonstrates the use of structures and typedefs in C programming.

## Structures

Structures are a way to group related data items together under a single name. This can make it easier to manage and access data, especially when dealing with complex data types.

To define a structure, you use the `struct` keyword followed by the structure name and curly braces to enclose the structure members. Each structure member is declared with its data type and member name. For example, the following code defines a structure named `Point` with two members, `x` and `y`, both of which are integers:

```c
struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
};


Once you have defined a structure, you can declare and initialize variables of that type. For example, the following code declares a variable named `p` of type `Point` and initializes its `x` and `y` members:

c
struct Point p = {10, 20};


You can access the members of a structure using the `.` operator. For example, the following code prints the values of the `x` and `y` members of the `p` struct:

c
printf("x = %d, y = %d\n", p.x, p.y);


## Typedefs

Typedefs are a way to create aliases for existing data types. This can make your code more readable and easier to maintain, especially when dealing with long or complex data types.

To create a typedef, you use the `typedef` keyword followed by the data type you want to create an alias for, the new type name, and a semicolon. For example, the following code creates a typedef named `Point_t` for the `struct Point` type:

c
typedef struct Point Point_t;


Once you have created a typedef, you can use it to declare variables of that type. For example, the following code declares a variable named `pt` of type `Point_t` and initializes its `x` and `y` members:

c
Point_t pt = {10, 20};


You can access the members of a typedefed type using the `.` operator just like you would with a regular struct. For example, the following code prints the values of the `x` and `y` members of the `pt` variable:

c
printf("x = %d, y = %d\n", pt.x, pt.y);


## Combining Structures and Typedefs

You can combine structures and typedefs to create a more concise and readable way to define and use complex data types. For example, the following code defines a structure named `Rectangle` with four members, `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`, and then creates a typedef named `Rectangle_t` for the `struct Rectangle` type:

c
struct Rectangle {
  int x;
  int y;
  int width;
  int height;
};

typedef struct Rectangle Rectangle_t;


Once you have defined the `Rectangle_t` typedef, you can use it to declare and initialize variables of type `Rectangle_t`. For example, the following code declares a variable named `rect` of type `Rectangle_t` and initializes its `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` members:

c
Rectangle_t rect = {10, 20, 50, 30};


You can access the members of a typedefed struct using the `.` operator just like you would with a regular struct. For example, the following code prints the values of the `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` members of the `rect` variable:

c
printf("x = %d, y = %d, width = %d, height = %d\n", rect.x, rect.y, rect.width, rect.height);


By using structures and typedefs, you can make your C code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain, especially when dealing with complex data types.
