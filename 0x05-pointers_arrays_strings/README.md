README for pointers_arrays_strings
This repository contains exercises and examples on pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Pointers are a powerful tool in C that allow you to directly access memory. Arrays are a data structure that allows you to store a collection of items of the same type. Strings are a special type of array that is used to store text.

To get started, clone this repository and build the exercises:

git clone https://github.com/bard/pointers_arrays_strings.git
cd pointers_arrays_strings
make
This will create a binary executable for each exercise. To run an exercise, simply type the name of the executable. For example, to run the exercise on arrays, you would type:

./arrays
The exercises will prompt you to enter data and perform various tasks. Once you have completed an exercise, you can compare your output to the expected output, which is provided in the expected_output directory.

If you are new to pointers, arrays, and strings, I recommend starting with the following exercises:

pointers/pointers_intro.c
arrays/arrays_intro.c
strings/strings_intro.c
These exercises will give you a basic understanding of how to use pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

Once you have completed the introductory exercises, you can move on to the more challenging exercises. These exercises will test your understanding of more advanced concepts, such as pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and string manipulation.

I hope you enjoy these exercises!
