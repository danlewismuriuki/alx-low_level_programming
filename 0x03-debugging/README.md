README 0x03-debugging

This folder contains the code and scripts necessary for debugging the ALX tasks.

Instructions:

To start debugging, open the project in your IDE of choice.
Set the breakpoint(s) where you want to start debugging.
Run the task in debug mode.
When the task reaches a breakpoint, the IDE will stop execution.
You can now examine the task state, step through the code line by line, and set new breakpoints.
To continue execution, press the appropriate key in your IDE.
Repeat steps 4-6 until you have identified and fixed the bug.
Tips:

Use comments to document your code and make it easier to understand.
Use logging to track the task's execution and identify potential problems.
Use assertions to verify that certain conditions are met.
Use unit tests to test individual components of the task.
Use integration tests to test the task as a whole.
Common debugging tasks:

Changing tests
Fixing bugs
Identifying the cause of crashes
Understanding the task's behavior
