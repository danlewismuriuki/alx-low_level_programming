README for 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This directory is a continuation of the previous directory, and contains the source code for the 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops project.

This project covers the following topics:

More functions
More nested loops
The requirements for this project are as follows:

All functions must be declared and defined in a header file.
All functions must be documented using comments.
All nested loops must be used to solve a specific problem.
All code must be compiled and run successfully.
Here are some examples of tasks that you can complete in this project:

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
Write a function to print the Pascal's triangle.
Write a function to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
Write a function to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.
Write a function to find the prime factorization of a number.
Once you have completed the project, you should submit your code to the repository.

Additional notes
This project is intended to be challenging, but it is also a great opportunity to learn more about functions and nested loops in C.
If you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many resources available online, and you can also ask your instructor or classmates for help.
Have fun and good luck!
