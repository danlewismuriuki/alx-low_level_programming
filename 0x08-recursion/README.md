What is recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. This allows the function to perform a task repeatedly, with each iteration of the function performing a smaller part of the task.

When to use recursion
Recursion can be used to solve a variety of problems, but it is especially useful for problems that involve breaking down a large problem into smaller, similar problems. For example, recursion is often used to solve problems such as traversing a tree or graph, sorting a list, and performing binary search.

Benefits of using recursion
One of the main benefits of using recursion is that it can make code more concise and elegant. Recursive functions can often be written in a few lines of code, even for complex problems.

Another benefit of using recursion is that it can be used to implement algorithms that are difficult or impossible to implement using iterative techniques. For example, recursive functions are often used to implement algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort.
