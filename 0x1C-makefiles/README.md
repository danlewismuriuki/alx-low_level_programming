Makefile Explanation
This README.md file provides an explanation of the common rules used in Makefiles, along with examples and usage instructions.

Overview
Makefiles are a powerful tool for automating the build process of software projects. They consist of rules that define how to compile source files, link object files, clean up generated files, and perform other tasks.

Common Rules
Compilation Rules
Compilation rules specify how to compile source files into object files.

Example:

Makefile
Copy code
%.o: %.c
    gcc -c $< -o $@
Linking Rules
Linking rules define how to link object files into executables or libraries.

Example:

Makefile
Copy code
my_program: main.o util.o
    gcc $^ -o $@
Cleaning Rules
Cleaning rules are used to remove generated files, such as object files or executables.

Example:

Makefile
Copy code
clean:
    rm -f *.o my_program
Phony Rules
Phony rules represent actions or tasks that don't correspond to actual files.

Example:

Makefile
Copy code
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -f *.o my_program
Usage
To use these rules in your Makefile:

Copy the desired rule into your Makefile.
Customize the rule as needed for your project.
Run make followed by the target name to execute the rule.
For example, to clean up generated files, run:

go
Copy code
make clean
Feel free to customize this README.md template further to suit your specific project or documentation needs.
