# alx low level programming

This repository contains my journey  to the low-level programming and algorithm assignments from the alx Africa Full Stack Software Engineer program.

The assignments in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including:

* C programming basics (variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, pointers, memory management, etc.)
* Data structures and algorithms (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, etc.)
* System programming (processes, threads, file I/O, networking, etc.)

This repository is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about low-level programming and algorithms. It is also a great way to practice your C programming skills.
