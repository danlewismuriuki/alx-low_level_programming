# 0x14-bit_manipulation

This repository contains C code illustrating concepts related to bit manipulation in the context of programming. Bit manipulation involves the manipulation of individual bits within binary representations of data. The code in this repository covers operations such as bitwise AND, OR, XOR, left/right shifting, and the creation of functions for converting binary strings to unsigned integers.

## Contents

- `0-binary_to_uint.c`: Implementation of a function to convert a binary string to an unsigned integer.
- `1-print_binary.c`: Implementation of a function to print the binary representation of a number.
- `2-get_bit.c`: Implementation of a function to get the value of a bit at a given index.
- `3-set_bit.c`: Implementation of a function to set the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
- `4-clear_bit.c`: Implementation of a function to set the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
- `5-flip_bits.c`: Implementation of a function to count the number of bits needed to convert one number to another.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code examples for a better understanding of bit manipulation in the C programming language. Each file contains a specific function or set of functions related to bit manipulation, along with comments for clarity.

## How to Run

Compile the C files using a C compiler. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-binary_to_uint.c -o binary_to_uint
./binary_to_uint
