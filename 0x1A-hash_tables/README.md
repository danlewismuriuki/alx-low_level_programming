# Hash Tables Implementation

This directory contains tasks and implementations related to hash tables, covering insertion, deletion, and other operations. Choose a task below to get started.

## Tasks

### 1. Basic Hash Table Implementation

- [ ] Implement a basic hash table with insertion and retrieval functionality.
- [ ] Test the implementation with a small dataset to ensure correct functioning.

### 2. Collision Handling

- [ ] Implement a collision resolution mechanism (choose from chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing).
- [ ] Test the hash table with a dataset that triggers collisions to ensure proper resolution.

### 3. Deletion Operation

- [ ] Implement the deletion operation in the hash table.
- [ ] Verify the correctness of the deletion operation through testing.

### 4. Chained Hashing

- [ ] Implement chained hashing as a collision resolution strategy.
- [ ] Test the hash table with a dataset that specifically tests the effectiveness of chained hashing.

### 5. Open Address Hashing

- [ ] Implement open address hashing as an alternative collision resolution strategy.
- [ ] Test the hash table with a dataset to evaluate the efficiency of open address hashing.

### 6. Advanced Optimizations

- [ ] Explore and implement advanced optimizations for hash tables (e.g., dynamic resizing, load factor management).
- [ ] Assess the performance improvements achieved by these optimizations.
