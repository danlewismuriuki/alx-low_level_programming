README for malloc_free

malloc and free are two of the most important functions in C. malloc is used to allocate memory dynamically, and free is used to release the memory that was allocated by malloc.

malloc

The malloc function takes the size of the memory block in bytes as its argument and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. If there is not enough memory available, malloc will return NULL.

Here is an example of how to use malloc to allocate memory for an array of integers:

C
int *array = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will allocate memory for an array of 10 integers and return a pointer to the first element in the array.

free

The free function takes a pointer to the memory block to be released as its argument. It is important to note that free can only be used to release memory that was allocated by malloc.

Here is an example of how to use free to release the memory allocated for the array in the previous example:

C
free(array);

It is important to note that it is important to call free on all memory that was allocated by malloc to avoid memory leaks.

Memory leaks

A memory leak occurs when memory that was allocated by malloc is not released by free. This can happen if the program crashes or if the memory is simply not released before the program exits.

Memory leaks can cause a number of problems, including:

Reduced performance: Memory leaks can cause the program to slow down and become unresponsive.
Increased memory usage: Memory leaks can cause the program to use more memory than necessary, which can lead to crashes and other problems.
System instability: Memory leaks can cause the system to become unstable and crash.
Avoiding memory leaks

There are a few things that you can do to avoid memory leaks:

Always call free on all memory that was allocated by malloc.
Use garbage collection to automatically manage memory.
Use a memory leak detector to identify and fix memory leaks in your code.
